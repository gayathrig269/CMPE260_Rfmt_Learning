# CMPE260_Rfmt_Learning
To train or teach a computer on how to play the game of Tic-Tac-Toe using different Reinforcement Learning concepts like Min Max algorithm to Neural Networks. 

Part 0:
Setting up a 3X3 Tic-Tac-Toe board.

Part 1:
Using Minimum-Maximum algorithm, train the agent to play against Random Player and itself. Results are plotted and statistics is taken for conclusion.

Part 2:
Using Tabular Q Learning policy, training the agent to perform better than Min-Max agents and Random player.Results are plotted and statistics is taken for conclusion

Part 3:
Using QLearning strategy, build a Neural Network to play against other agents. Experimented with Epsilon parameter to use less greedy approach. Used other activation functions like tanh,sigmoid,leaky reLU and other optimzer- Adam. Plots against every RL agent is analysed for every battle.
